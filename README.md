To run this program, ensure that you have a working installation of python on your computer and you
have pygame installed (do pip install pygame if you haven't already)

Then, run main.py and the program should work.

This program is an automatic scheduling app, like YRHACKS2022's project but better (go to https://github.com/chaosium43/YRHACKS22 if you don't know what I'm talking about). Basically, you enter in your daily routine
(there's a menu that allows you to do that), then enter specific tasks you need to do (tasks are one time vs routines which are recurring), and the program automatically generates a schedule for you!
